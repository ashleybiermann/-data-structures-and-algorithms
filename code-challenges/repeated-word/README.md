##  Repeated Word

### Challenge: Write a function that accepts a string and returns the first word to occur more than once. 
- Accepts a lengthy string parameter
- Return the first word to occur more than once in that provided string
- Use no built-in library methods available to your language

### Approach & Efficiency
- TIME complexity: O(n) - could go through all words in string
- SPACE complexity: O(log2n) - creates a hashTable and an extra array to hold string
