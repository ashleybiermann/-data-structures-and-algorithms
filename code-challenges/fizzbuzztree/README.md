# FizzBuzz Tree

### Challenge

- Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a k-ary tree as an argument.
- Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:
  - If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
  - If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
  - If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
  - If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.
- Return a new tree.
