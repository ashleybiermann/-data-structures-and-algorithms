# Graphs

## Implement Graph

### Challenge 

The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

- AddNode // addVertex( )
  - Adds a new node to the graph
  - Takes in the value of that node
  - Returns the added node

- AddEdge // addEdge( )
  - Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
  - Include the ability to have a “weight”
  - Takes in the two nodes to be connected by the edge
  - Both nodes should already be in the Graph

- GetNodes // getNodes( )
  - Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)

- GetNeighbors // getNeighbors( )
  - Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
  - Takes in a given node
  - Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection

- Size // size( )
  - Returns the total number of nodes in the graph

### Approach & Efficiency
- TIME complexity:
- SPACE complexity:
